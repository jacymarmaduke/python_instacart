# python_instacart

## About
This repository contains analysis of Instacart customers'grocery shopping habits. The contents include the Python scripts I wrote to analyze the data, visualizations I created in Python and my final report with hand-crafted customer profiles and recommendations.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze order data and customer demographics to produce insights about Instacart shopping habits and suggest new ways to segment customers through profiling. 

## Data
The order data, procured via Kaggle, encompasses over 600,000 Instacart orders, including product details, order timing and customer order history. View more details about the Instacart data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis?select=orders.csv).

Career Foundry generated additional datasets containing mock product prices and customer demographic information for the purpose of this project. 

## Contents
**Instacart project brief:** Contains additional information about project specifications.

**Scripts:** Contains 18 Jupyter notebooks where I carried out data analysis. The scripts catalogue every step of the process, from data cleaning and wrangling to data visualization to the development of customer profiles.

**Visualizations:** Contains seven data visualizations illustrating shopping patterns and two sets of indepentldy designed customer profiles. I created the visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

**Findings and recommendations:** An Excel workbook containing the population flow for my analysis, a detailed record of data cleaning and wrangling, all my visualizations, answers to ad-hoc questions about the data and an account of my customer profiles and recommendations. 

## Note
I went beyond project requirements to design two sets of customer profiles, one based on the mock demographic data provided by Career Foundry and another based entirely on the real Instacart shopping data. The latter profiles segmented customers by their preferred time of day for placing orders.
